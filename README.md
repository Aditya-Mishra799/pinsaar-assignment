# DropLater (Pinsaar Take-Home Assignment)

## 🚀 How to Run

No installation steps needed. Just clone and run:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
docker compose up
```

That’s it. All environment variables are already configured inside the `docker-compose.yml` (⚠️ only for simplicity in this test setup).

Services that will start:

* **api** → Node/Express API
* **worker** → Processes scheduled notes
* **mongo** → MongoDB storage
* **redis** → Redis for queues
* **sink** → Webhook receiver (`http://sink:4000/sink`)
* **react-admin** → Tiny React admin panel
